    <span class="s4">&quot;&quot;&quot;Put the current task to sleep, with cancellation support. 
 
    This is the lowest-level API for blocking in Trio. Every time a 
    :class:`~trio.lowlevel.Task` blocks, it does so by calling this function 
    (usually indirectly via some higher-level API). 
 
    This is a tricky interface with no guard rails. If you can use 
    :class:`ParkingLot` or the built-in I/O wait functions instead, then you 
    should. 
 
    Generally the way it works is that before calling this function, you make 
    arrangements for &quot;someone&quot; to call :func:`reschedule` on the current task 
    at some later point. 
 
    Then you call :func:`wait_task_rescheduled`, passing in ``abort_func``, an 
    &quot;abort callback&quot;. 
 
    (Terminology: in Trio, &quot;aborting&quot; is the process of attempting to 
    interrupt a blocked task to deliver a cancellation.) 
 
    There are two possibilities for what happens next: 
 
    1. &quot;Someone&quot; calls :func:`reschedule` on the current task, and 
       :func:`wait_task_rescheduled` returns or raises whatever value or error 
       was passed to :func:`reschedule`. 
 
    2. The call's context transitions to a cancelled state (e.g. due to a 
       timeout expiring). When this happens, the ``abort_func`` is called. Its 
       interface looks like:: 
 
           def abort_func(raise_cancel): 
               ... 
               return trio.lowlevel.Abort.SUCCEEDED  # or FAILED 
 
       It should attempt to clean up any state associated with this call, and 
       in particular, arrange that :func:`reschedule` will *not* be called 
       later. If (and only if!) it is successful, then it should return 
       :data:`Abort.SUCCEEDED`, in which case the task will automatically be 
       rescheduled with an appropriate :exc:`~trio.Cancelled` error. 
 
       Otherwise, it should return :data:`Abort.FAILED`. This means that the 
       task can't be cancelled at this time, and still has to make sure that 
       &quot;someone&quot; eventually calls :func:`reschedule`. 
 
       At that point there are again two possibilities. You can simply ignore 
       the cancellation altogether: wait for the operation to complete and 
       then reschedule and continue as normal. (For example, this is what 
       :func:`trio.to_thread.run_sync` does if cancellation is disabled.) 
       The other possibility is that the ``abort_func`` does succeed in 
       cancelling the operation, but for some reason isn't able to report that 
       right away. (Example: on Windows, it's possible to request that an 
       async (&quot;overlapped&quot;) I/O operation be cancelled, but this request is 
       *also* asynchronous – you don't find out until later whether the 
       operation was actually cancelled or not.)  To report a delayed 
       cancellation, then you should reschedule the task yourself, and call 
       the ``raise_cancel`` callback passed to ``abort_func`` to raise a 
       :exc:`~trio.Cancelled` (or possibly :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt`) exception 
       into this task. Either of the approaches sketched below can work:: 
 
          # Option 1: 
          # Catch the exception from raise_cancel and inject it into the task. 
          # (This is what Trio does automatically for you if you return 
          # Abort.SUCCEEDED.) 
          trio.lowlevel.reschedule(task, outcome.capture(raise_cancel)) 
 
          # Option 2: 
          # wait to be woken by &quot;someone&quot;, and then decide whether to raise 
          # the error from inside the task. 
          outer_raise_cancel = None 
          def abort(inner_raise_cancel): 
              nonlocal outer_raise_cancel 
              outer_raise_cancel = inner_raise_cancel 
              TRY_TO_CANCEL_OPERATION() 
              return trio.lowlevel.Abort.FAILED 
          await wait_task_rescheduled(abort) 
          if OPERATION_WAS_SUCCESSFULLY_CANCELLED: 
              # raises the error 
              outer_raise_cancel() 
 
       In any case it's guaranteed that we only call the ``abort_func`` at most 
       once per call to :func:`wait_task_rescheduled`. 
 
    Sometimes, it's useful to be able to share some mutable sleep-related data 
    between the sleeping task, the abort function, and the waking task. You 
    can use the sleeping task's :data:`~Task.custom_sleep_data` attribute to 
    store this data, and Trio won't touch it, except to make sure that it gets 
    cleared when the task is rescheduled. 
 
    .. warning:: 
 
       If your ``abort_func`` raises an error, or returns any value other than 
       :data:`Abort.SUCCEEDED` or :data:`Abort.FAILED`, then Trio will crash 
       violently. Be careful! Similarly, it is entirely possible to deadlock a 
       Trio program by failing to reschedule a blocked task, or cause havoc by 
       calling :func:`reschedule` too many times. Remember what we said up 
       above about how you should use a higher-level API if at all possible?

    Normally, a Trio task doesn't exit until its coroutine object exits. When 
    you call this function, Trio acts like the coroutine object just exited 
    and the task terminates with the given outcome. This is useful if you want 
    to permanently switch the coroutine object over to a different coroutine 
    runner. 
 
    When the calling coroutine enters this function it's running under Trio, 
    and when the function returns it's running under the foreign coroutine 
    runner. 
 
    You should make sure that the coroutine object has released any 
    Trio-specific resources it has acquired (e.g. nurseries). 
 
    Args: 
      final_outcome (outcome.Outcome): Trio acts as if the current task exited 
          with the given return value or exception.

    scheduler. 
 
    When the calling coroutine enters this function it's running under Trio, 
    and when the function returns it's running under the foreign coroutine 
    runner. 
 
    The Trio :class:`Task` will continue to exist, but will be suspended until 
    you use :func:`reattach_detached_coroutine_object` to resume it. In the 
    mean time, you can use another coroutine runner to schedule the coroutine 
    object. In fact, you have to – the function doesn't return until the 
    coroutine is advanced from outside. 
 
    Note that you'll need to save the current :class:`Task` object to later 
    resume; you can retrieve it with :func:`current_task`. You can also use 
    this :class:`Task` object to retrieve the coroutine object – see 
    :data:`Task.coro`. 
 
    Args: 
      abort_func: Same as for :func:`wait_task_rescheduled`, except that it 
          must return :data:`Abort.FAILED`. (If it returned 
          :data:`Abort.SUCCEEDED`, then Trio would attempt to reschedule the 
          detached task directly without going through 
          :func:`reattach_detached_coroutine_object`, which would be bad.) 
          Your ``abort_func`` should still arrange for whatever the coroutine 
          object is doing to be cancelled, and then reattach to Trio and call 
          the ``raise_cancel`` callback, if possible.

    When the calling coroutine enters this function it's running under the

    Trio. 
 
    This must be called from inside the coroutine being resumed, and yields 
    whatever value you pass in. (Presumably you'll pass a value that will 
    cause the current coroutine runner to stop scheduling this task.) Then the
