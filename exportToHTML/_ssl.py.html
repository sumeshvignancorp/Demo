<pre><span class="s0"># General theory of operation:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># We implement an API that closely mirrors the stdlib ssl module's blocking</span>
<span class="s0"># API, and we do it using the stdlib ssl module's non-blocking in-memory API.</span>
<span class="s0"># The stdlib non-blocking in-memory API is barely documented, and acts as a</span>
<span class="s0"># thin wrapper around openssl, whose documentation also leaves something to be</span>
<span class="s0"># desired. So here's the main things you need to know to understand the code</span>
<span class="s0"># in this file:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># We use an ssl.SSLObject, which exposes the four main I/O operations:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># - do_handshake: performs the initial handshake. Must be called once at the</span>
<span class="s0">#   beginning of each connection; is a no-op once it's completed once.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># - write: takes some unencrypted data and attempts to send it to the remote</span>
<span class="s0">#   peer.</span>

<span class="s0"># - read: attempts to decrypt and return some data from the remote peer.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># - unwrap: this is weirdly named; maybe it helps to realize that the thing it</span>
<span class="s0">#   wraps is called SSL_shutdown. It sends a cryptographically signed message</span>
<span class="s0">#   saying &quot;I'm closing this connection now&quot;, and then waits to receive the</span>
<span class="s0">#   same from the remote peer (unless we already received one, in which case</span>
<span class="s0">#   it returns immediately).</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># All of these operations read and write from some in-memory buffers called</span>
<span class="s0"># &quot;BIOs&quot;, which are an opaque OpenSSL-specific object that's basically</span>
<span class="s0"># semantically equivalent to a Python bytearray. When they want to send some</span>
<span class="s0"># bytes to the remote peer, they append them to the outgoing BIO, and when</span>
<span class="s0"># they want to receive some bytes from the remote peer, they try to pull them</span>
<span class="s0"># out of the incoming BIO. &quot;Sending&quot; always succeeds, because the outgoing BIO</span>
<span class="s0"># can always be extended to hold more data. &quot;Receiving&quot; acts sort of like a</span>
<span class="s0"># non-blocking socket: it might manage to get some data immediately, or it</span>
<span class="s0"># might fail and need to be tried again later. We can also directly add or</span>
<span class="s0"># remove data from the BIOs whenever we want.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Now the problem is that while these I/O operations are opaque atomic</span>
<span class="s0"># operations from the point of view of us calling them, under the hood they</span>
<span class="s0"># might require some arbitrary sequence of sends and receives from the remote</span>
<span class="s0"># peer. This is particularly true for do_handshake, which generally requires a</span>
<span class="s0"># few round trips, but it's also true for write and read, due to an evil thing</span>
<span class="s0"># called &quot;renegotiation&quot;.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Renegotiation is the process by which one of the peers might arbitrarily</span>
<span class="s0"># decide to redo the handshake at any time. Did I mention it's evil? It's</span>
<span class="s0"># pretty evil, and almost universally hated. The HTTP/2 spec forbids the use</span>
<span class="s0"># of TLS renegotiation for HTTP/2 connections. TLS 1.3 removes it from the</span>
<span class="s0"># protocol entirely. It's impossible to trigger a renegotiation if using</span>
<span class="s0"># Python's ssl module. OpenSSL's renegotiation support is pretty buggy [1].</span>
<span class="s0"># Nonetheless, it does get used in real life, mostly in two cases:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># 1) Normally in TLS 1.2 and below, when the client side of a connection wants</span>
<span class="s0"># to present a certificate to prove their identity, that certificate gets sent</span>
<span class="s0"># in plaintext. This is bad, because it means that anyone eavesdropping can</span>
<span class="s0"># see who's connecting – it's like sending your username in plain text. Not as</span>
<span class="s0"># bad as sending your password in plain text, but still, pretty bad. However,</span>
<span class="s0"># renegotiations *are* encrypted. So as a workaround, it's not uncommon for</span>
<span class="s0"># systems that want to use client certificates to first do an anonymous</span>
<span class="s0"># handshake, and then to turn around and do a second handshake (=</span>
<span class="s0"># renegotiation) and this time ask for a client cert. Or sometimes this is</span>
<span class="s0"># done on a case-by-case basis, e.g. a web server might accept a connection,</span>
<span class="s0"># read the request, and then once it sees the page you're asking for it might</span>
<span class="s0"># stop and ask you for a certificate.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># 2) In principle the same TLS connection can be used for an arbitrarily long</span>
<span class="s0"># time, and might transmit arbitrarily large amounts of data. But this creates</span>
<span class="s0"># a cryptographic problem: an attacker who has access to arbitrarily large</span>
<span class="s0"># amounts of data that's all encrypted using the same key may eventually be</span>
<span class="s0"># able to use this to figure out the key. Is this a real practical problem? I</span>
<span class="s0"># have no idea, I'm not a cryptographer. In any case, some people worry that</span>
<span class="s0"># it's a problem, so their TLS libraries are designed to automatically trigger</span>
<span class="s0"># a renegotiation every once in a while on some sort of timer.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># The end result is that you might be going along, minding your own business,</span>
<span class="s0"># and then *bam*! a wild renegotiation appears! And you just have to cope.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># The reason that coping with renegotiations is difficult is that some</span>
<span class="s0"># unassuming &quot;read&quot; or &quot;write&quot; call might find itself unable to progress until</span>
<span class="s0"># it does a handshake, which remember is a process with multiple round</span>
<span class="s0"># trips. So read might have to send data, and write might have to receive</span>
<span class="s0"># data, and this might happen multiple times. And some of those attempts might</span>
<span class="s0"># fail because there isn't any data yet, and need to be retried. Managing all</span>
<span class="s0"># this is pretty complicated.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Here's how openssl (and thus the stdlib ssl module) handle this. All of the</span>
<span class="s0"># I/O operations above follow the same rules. When you call one of them:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># - it might write some data to the outgoing BIO</span>
<span class="s0"># - it might read some data from the incoming BIO</span>
<span class="s0"># - it might raise SSLWantReadError if it can't complete without reading more</span>
<span class="s0">#   data from the incoming BIO. This is important: the &quot;read&quot; in ReadError</span>
<span class="s0">#   refers to reading from the *underlying* stream.</span>
<span class="s0"># - (and in principle it might raise SSLWantWriteError too, but that never</span>
<span class="s0">#   happens when using memory BIOs, so never mind)</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># If it doesn't raise an error, then the operation completed successfully</span>
<span class="s0"># (though we still need to take any outgoing data out of the memory buffer and</span>
<span class="s0"># put it onto the wire). If it *does* raise an error, then we need to retry</span>
<span class="s0"># *exactly that method call* later – in particular, if a 'write' failed, we</span>
<span class="s0"># need to try again later *with the same data*, because openssl might have</span>
<span class="s0"># already committed some of the initial parts of our data to its output even</span>
<span class="s0"># though it didn't tell us that, and has remembered that the next time we call</span>
<span class="s0"># write it needs to skip the first 1024 bytes or whatever it is. (Well,</span>
<span class="s0"># technically, we're actually allowed to call 'write' again with a data buffer</span>
<span class="s0"># which is the same as our old one PLUS some extra stuff added onto the end,</span>
<span class="s0"># but in Trio that never comes up so never mind.)</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># There are some people online who claim that once you've gotten a Want*Error</span>
<span class="s0"># then the *very next call* you make to openssl *must* be the same as the</span>
<span class="s0"># previous one. I'm pretty sure those people are wrong. In particular, it's</span>
<span class="s0"># okay to call write, get a WantReadError, and then call read a few times;</span>
<span class="s0"># it's just that *the next time you call write*, it has to be with the same</span>
<span class="s0"># data.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># One final wrinkle: we want our SSLStream to support full-duplex operation,</span>
<span class="s0"># i.e. it should be possible for one task to be calling send_all while another</span>
<span class="s0"># task is calling receive_some. But renegotiation makes this a big hassle, because</span>
<span class="s0"># even if SSLStream's restricts themselves to one task calling send_all and one</span>
<span class="s0"># task calling receive_some, those two tasks might end up both wanting to call</span>
<span class="s0"># send_all, or both to call receive_some at the same time *on the underlying</span>
<span class="s0"># stream*. So we have to do some careful locking to hide this problem from our</span>
<span class="s0"># users.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># (Renegotiation is evil.)</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># So our basic strategy is to define a single helper method called &quot;_retry&quot;,</span>
<span class="s0"># which has generic logic for dealing with SSLWantReadError, pushing data from</span>
<span class="s0"># the outgoing BIO to the wire, reading data from the wire to the incoming</span>
<span class="s0"># BIO, retrying an I/O call until it works, and synchronizing with other tasks</span>
<span class="s0"># that might be calling _retry concurrently. Basically it takes an SSLObject</span>
<span class="s0"># non-blocking in-memory method and converts it into a Trio async blocking</span>
<span class="s0"># method. _retry is only about 30 lines of code, but all these cases</span>
<span class="s0"># multiplied by concurrent calls make it extremely tricky, so there are lots</span>
<span class="s0"># of comments down below on the details, and a really extensive test suite in</span>
<span class="s0"># test_ssl.py. And now you know *why* it's so tricky, and can probably</span>
<span class="s0"># understand how it works.</span>

<span class="s0"># XX how closely should we match the stdlib API?</span>
<span class="s0"># - maybe suppress_ragged_eofs=False is a better default?</span>
<span class="s0"># - maybe check crypto folks for advice?</span>
<span class="s0"># - this is also interesting: https://bugs.python.org/issue8108#msg102867</span>

<span class="s0"># Definitely keep an eye on Cory's TLS API ideas on security-sig etc.</span>

<span class="s0"># XX document behavior on cancellation/error (i.e.: all is lost abandon</span>
<span class="s0"># stream)</span>
<span class="s0"># docs will need to make very clear that this is different from all the other</span>
<span class="s0"># cancellations in core Trio</span>

<span class="s0"># Ideally, when the user calls SSLStream.receive_some() with no argument, then</span>
<span class="s0"># we should do exactly one call to self.transport_stream.receive_some(),</span>
<span class="s0"># decrypt everything we got, and return it. Unfortunately, the way openssl's</span>
<span class="s0"># API works, we have to pick how much data we want to allow when we call</span>
<span class="s0"># read(), and then it (potentially) triggers a call to</span>
<span class="s0"># transport_stream.receive_some(). So at the time we pick the amount of data</span>
<span class="s0"># to decrypt, we don't know how much data we've read. As a simple heuristic,</span>
<span class="s0"># we record the max amount of data returned by previous calls to</span>
<span class="s0"># transport_stream.receive_some(), and we use that for future calls to read().</span>
<span class="s0"># But what do we use for the very first call? That's what this constant sets.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Note that the value passed to read() is a limit on the amount of</span>
<span class="s0"># *decrypted* data, but we can only see the size of the *encrypted* data</span>
<span class="s0"># returned by transport_stream.receive_some(). TLS adds a small amount of</span>
<span class="s0"># framing overhead, and TLS compression is rarely used these days because it's</span>
<span class="s0"># insecure. So the size of the encrypted data should be a slight over-estimate</span>
<span class="s0"># of the size of the decrypted data, which is exactly what we want.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># The specific value is not really based on anything; it might be worth tuning</span>
<span class="s0"># at some point. But, if you have an TCP connection with the typical 1500 byte</span>
<span class="s0"># MTU and an initial window of 10 (see RFC 6928), then the initial burst of</span>
<span class="s0"># data will be limited to ~15000 bytes (or a bit less due to IP-level framing</span>
<span class="s0"># overhead), so this is chosen to be larger than that.</span>

    <span class="s6">r&quot;&quot;&quot;Encrypted communication using SSL/TLS. 
 
    :class:`SSLStream` wraps an arbitrary :class:`~trio.abc.Stream`, and 
    allows you to perform encrypted communication over it using the usual 
    :class:`~trio.abc.Stream` interface. You pass regular data to 
    :meth:`send_all`, then it encrypts it and sends the encrypted data on the 
    underlying :class:`~trio.abc.Stream`; :meth:`receive_some` takes encrypted 
    data out of the underlying :class:`~trio.abc.Stream` and decrypts it 
    before returning it. 
 
    You should read the standard library's :mod:`ssl` documentation carefully 
    before attempting to use this class, and probably other general 
    documentation on SSL/TLS as well. SSL/TLS is subtle and quick to 
    anger. Really. I'm not kidding. 
 
    Args: 
      transport_stream (~trio.abc.Stream): The stream used to transport 
          encrypted data. Required. 
 
      ssl_context (~ssl.SSLContext): The :class:`~ssl.SSLContext` used for 
          this connection. Required. Usually created by calling 
          :func:`ssl.create_default_context`. 
 
      server_hostname (str or None): The name of the server being connected 
          to. Used for `SNI 
          &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication&gt;`__ and for 
          validating the server's certificate (if hostname checking is 
          enabled). This is effectively mandatory for clients, and actually 
          mandatory if ``ssl_context.check_hostname`` is ``True``. 
 
      server_side (bool): Whether this stream is acting as a client or 
          server. Defaults to False, i.e. client mode. 
 
      https_compatible (bool): There are two versions of SSL/TLS commonly 
          encountered in the wild: the standard version, and the version used 
          for HTTPS (HTTP-over-SSL/TLS). 
 
          Standard-compliant SSL/TLS implementations always send a 
          cryptographically signed ``close_notify`` message before closing the 
          connection. This is important because if the underlying transport 
          were simply closed, then there wouldn't be any way for the other 
          side to know whether the connection was intentionally closed by the 
          peer that they negotiated a cryptographic connection to, or by some 
          `man-in-the-middle 
          &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack&gt;`__ attacker 
          who can't manipulate the cryptographic stream, but can manipulate 
          the transport layer (a so-called &quot;truncation attack&quot;). 
 
          However, this part of the standard is widely ignored by real-world 
          HTTPS implementations, which means that if you want to interoperate 
          with them, then you NEED to ignore it too. 
 
          Fortunately this isn't as bad as it sounds, because the HTTP 
          protocol already includes its own equivalent of ``close_notify``, so 
          doing this again at the SSL/TLS level is redundant. But not all 
          protocols do! Therefore, by default Trio implements the safer 
          standard-compliant version (``https_compatible=False``). But if 
          you're speaking HTTPS or some other protocol where 
          ``close_notify``\s are commonly skipped, then you should set 
          ``https_compatible=True``; with this setting, Trio will neither 
          expect nor send ``close_notify`` messages. 
 
          If you have code that was written to use :class:`ssl.SSLSocket` and 
          now you're porting it to Trio, then it may be useful to know that a 
          difference between :class:`SSLStream` and :class:`ssl.SSLSocket` is 
          that :class:`~ssl.SSLSocket` implements the 
          ``https_compatible=True`` behavior by default. 
 
    Attributes: 
      transport_stream (trio.abc.Stream): The underlying transport stream 
          that was passed to ``__init__``. An example of when this would be 
          useful is if you're using :class:`SSLStream` over a 
          :class:`~trio.SocketStream` and want to call the 
          :class:`~trio.SocketStream`'s :meth:`~trio.SocketStream.setsockopt` 
          method. 
 
    Internally, this class is implemented using an instance of 
    :class:`ssl.SSLObject`, and all of :class:`~ssl.SSLObject`'s methods and 
    attributes are re-exported as methods and attributes on this class. 
    However, there is one difference: :class:`~ssl.SSLObject` has several 
    methods that return information about the encrypted connection, like 
    :meth:`~ssl.SSLSocket.cipher` or 
    :meth:`~ssl.SSLSocket.selected_alpn_protocol`. If you call them before the 
    handshake, when they can't possibly return useful data, then 
    :class:`ssl.SSLObject` returns None, but :class:`trio.SSLStream` 
    raises :exc:`NeedHandshakeError`. 
 
    This also means that if you register a SNI callback using 
    `~ssl.SSLContext.sni_callback`, then the first argument your callback 
    receives will be a :class:`ssl.SSLObject`.

            <span class="s0">#</span>
            <span class="s0"># - receive_some some data and put it into the incoming BIO</span>
            <span class="s0">#</span>
            <span class="s0"># Our strategy is: if there's data to send, send it;</span>
            <span class="s0"># *otherwise* if there's data to receive_some, receive_some it.</span>

            <span class="s0"># If both need to happen, then we only send. Why? Well, we</span>
            <span class="s0"># know that *right now* we have to both send and receive_some</span>
            <span class="s0"># before the operation can complete. But as soon as we yield,</span>
            <span class="s0"># that information becomes potentially stale – e.g. while</span>
            <span class="s0"># we're sending, some other task might go and receive_some the</span>
            <span class="s0"># data we need and put it into the incoming BIO. And if it</span>
            <span class="s0"># does, then we *definitely don't* want to do a receive_some –</span>
            <span class="s0"># there might not be any more data coming, and we'd deadlock!</span>
            <span class="s0"># We could do something tricky to keep track of whether a</span>
            <span class="s0"># receive_some happens while we're sending, but the case where</span>
            <span class="s0"># we have to do both is very unusual (only during a</span>
            <span class="s0"># renegotiation), so it's better to keep things simple. So we</span>
            <span class="s0"># do just one potentially-blocking operation, then check again</span>
            <span class="s0"># for fresh information.</span>
            <span class="s0">#</span>
            <span class="s0"># And we prioritize sending over receiving because, if there</span>
            <span class="s0"># are multiple tasks that want to receive_some, then it</span>
            <span class="s0"># doesn't matter what order they go in. But if there are</span>
            <span class="s0"># multiple tasks that want to send, then they each have</span>
            <span class="s0"># different data, and the data needs to get put onto the wire</span>
            <span class="s0"># in the same order that it was retrieved from the outgoing</span>
            <span class="s0"># BIO. So if we have data to send, that *needs* to be the</span>
            <span class="s0"># *very* *next* *thing* we do, to make sure no-one else sneaks</span>
            <span class="s0"># in before us. Or if we can't send immediately because</span>
            <span class="s0"># someone else is, then we at least need to get in line</span>

        The SSL protocol requires an initial handshake to exchange 
        certificates, select cryptographic keys, and so forth, before any 
        actual data can be sent or received. You don't have to call this 
        method; if you don't, then :class:`SSLStream` will automatically 
        perform the handshake as needed, the first time you try to send or 
        receive data. But if you want to trigger it manually – for example, 
        because you want to look at the peer's certificate before you start 
        talking to them – then you can call this method. 
 
        If the initial handshake is already in progress in another task, this 
        waits for it to complete and then returns. 
 
        If the initial handshake has already completed, this returns 
        immediately without doing anything (except executing a checkpoint). 
 
        .. warning:: If this method is cancelled, then it may leave the 
           :class:`SSLStream` in an unusable state. If this happens then any 
           future attempt to use the object will raise 
           :exc:`trio.BrokenResourceError`.

            <span class="s0"># they aren't paying attention (e.g., if they're just sending</span>

            <span class="s0"># require the other side to always be receiving, because (a)</span>
            <span class="s0"># backpressure is kind of important, and (b) I bet there are</span>
            <span class="s0"># broken TLS implementations out there that don't receive all the</span>
            <span class="s0"># time. (Like e.g. anyone using Python ssl in synchronous mode.)</span>
            <span class="s0">#</span>
            <span class="s0"># The send-then-immediately-close behavior is explicitly allowed</span>
            <span class="s0"># by the TLS specs, so we're ok on that.</span>
            <span class="s0">#</span>
            <span class="s0"># Subtlety: SSLObject.unwrap will immediately call it a second</span>

            <span class="s0"># there hasn't been time for the other side to respond</span>
            <span class="s0"># yet. (Unless they spontaneously sent a close_notify before we</span>
            <span class="s0"># called this, and it's either already been processed or gets</span>
            <span class="s0"># pulled out of the buffer by Python's second call.) So the way to</span>
            <span class="s0"># do what we want is to ignore SSLWantReadError on this call.</span>
            <span class="s0">#</span>
            <span class="s0"># Also, because the other side might have already sent</span>
            <span class="s0"># close_notify and closed their connection then it's possible that</span>
            <span class="s0"># our attempt to send close_notify will raise</span>
            <span class="s0"># BrokenResourceError. This is totally legal, and in fact can happen</span>
            <span class="s0"># with two well-behaved Trio programs talking to each other, so we</span>
            <span class="s0"># don't want to raise an error. So we suppress BrokenResourceError</span>
            <span class="s0"># here. (This is safe, because literally the only thing this call</span>
            <span class="s0"># to _retry will do is send the close_notify alert, so that's</span>
            <span class="s0"># surely where the error comes from.)</span>
            <span class="s0">#</span>
            <span class="s0"># FYI in some cases this could also raise SSLSyscallError which I</span>
            <span class="s0"># think is because SSL_shutdown is terrible. (Check out that note</span>
            <span class="s0"># at the bottom of the man page saying that it sometimes gets</span>
            <span class="s0"># raised spuriously.) I haven't seen this since we switched to</span>
            <span class="s0"># immediately closing the socket, and I don't know exactly what</span>
            <span class="s0"># conditions cause it and how to respond, so for now we're just</span>
            <span class="s0"># letting that happen. But if you start seeing it, then hopefully</span>
            <span class="s0"># this will give you a little head start on tracking it down,</span>
            <span class="s0"># because whoa did this puzzle us at the 2017 PyCon sprints.</span>
            <span class="s0">#</span>
            <span class="s0"># Also, if someone else is blocked in send/receive, then we aren't</span>

    <span class="s6">&quot;&quot;&quot;A :class:`~trio.abc.Listener` for SSL/TLS-encrypted servers. 
 
    :class:`SSLListener` wraps around another Listener, and converts 
    all incoming connections to encrypted connections by wrapping them 
    in a :class:`SSLStream`. 
 
    Args: 
      transport_listener (~trio.abc.Listener): The listener whose incoming 
          connections will be wrapped in :class:`SSLStream`. 
 
      ssl_context (~ssl.SSLContext): The :class:`~ssl.SSLContext` that will be 
          used for incoming connections. 
 
      https_compatible (bool): Passed on to :class:`SSLStream`. 
 
    Attributes: 
      transport_listener (trio.abc.Listener): The underlying listener that was 
          passed to ``__init__``.
