<span class="s4"># Implementation of RFC 6555 &quot;Happy eyeballs&quot;</span>
<span class="s4"># https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># Basically, the problem here is that if we want to connect to some host, and</span>
<span class="s4"># DNS returns multiple IP addresses, then we don't know which of them will</span>
<span class="s4"># actually work -- it can happen that some of them are reachable, and some of</span>
<span class="s4"># them are not. One particularly common situation where this happens is on a</span>
<span class="s4"># host that thinks it has ipv6 connectivity, but really doesn't. But in</span>
<span class="s4"># principle this could happen for any kind of multi-home situation (e.g. the</span>
<span class="s4"># route to one mirror is down but another is up).</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># The naive algorithm (e.g. the stdlib's socket.create_connection) would be to</span>
<span class="s4"># pick one of the IP addresses and try to connect; if that fails, try the</span>
<span class="s4"># next; etc. The problem with this is that TCP is stubborn, and if the first</span>
<span class="s4"># address is a blackhole then it might take a very long time (tens of seconds)</span>
<span class="s4"># before that connection attempt fails.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># That's where RFC 6555 comes in. It tells us that what we do is:</span>
<span class="s4"># - get the list of IPs from getaddrinfo, trusting the order it gives us (with</span>
<span class="s4">#   one exception noted in section 5.4)</span>
<span class="s4"># - start a connection attempt to the first IP</span>
<span class="s4"># - when this fails OR if it's still going after DELAY seconds, then start a</span>
<span class="s4">#   connection attempt to the second IP</span>
<span class="s4"># - when this fails OR if it's still going after another DELAY seconds, then</span>
<span class="s4">#   start a connection attempt to the third IP</span>
<span class="s4"># - ... repeat until we run out of IPs.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># Our implementation is similarly straightforward: we spawn a chain of tasks,</span>
<span class="s4"># where each one (a) waits until the previous connection has failed or DELAY</span>
<span class="s4"># seconds have passed, (b) spawns the next task, (c) attempts to connect. As</span>
<span class="s4"># soon as any task crashes or succeeds, we cancel all the tasks and return.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># Note: this currently doesn't attempt to cache any results, so if you make</span>
<span class="s4"># multiple connections to the same host it'll re-run the happy-eyeballs</span>
<span class="s4"># algorithm each time. RFC 6555 is pretty confusing about whether this is</span>
<span class="s4"># allowed. Section 4 describes an algorithm that attempts ipv4 and ipv6</span>
<span class="s4"># simultaneously, and then says &quot;The client MUST cache information regarding</span>
<span class="s4"># the outcome of each connection attempt, and it uses that information to</span>
<span class="s4"># avoid thrashing the network with subsequent attempts.&quot; Then section 4.2 says</span>
<span class="s4"># &quot;implementations MUST prefer the first IP address family returned by the</span>
<span class="s4"># host's address preference policy, unless implementing a stateful</span>
<span class="s4"># algorithm&quot;. Here &quot;stateful&quot; means &quot;one that caches information about</span>
<span class="s4"># previous attempts&quot;. So my reading of this is that IF you're starting ipv4</span>
<span class="s4"># and ipv6 at the same time then you MUST cache the result for ~ten minutes,</span>
<span class="s4"># but IF you're &quot;preferring&quot; one protocol by trying it first (like we are),</span>
<span class="s4"># then you don't need to cache.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># Caching is quite tricky: to get it right you need to do things like detect</span>
<span class="s4"># when the network interfaces are reconfigured, and if you get it wrong then</span>
<span class="s4"># connection attempts basically just don't work. So we don't even try.</span>

<span class="s4"># &quot;Firefox and Chrome use 300 ms&quot;</span>
<span class="s4"># https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555#section-6</span>
<span class="s4"># Though</span>
<span class="s4">#   https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vaibhav_Bajpai3/publication/304568993_Measuring_the_Effects_of_Happy_Eyeballs/links/5773848e08ae6f328f6c284c/Measuring-the-Effects-of-Happy-Eyeballs.pdf</span>
<span class="s4"># claims that Firefox actually uses 0 ms, unless an about:config option is</span>
<span class="s4"># toggled and then it uses 250 ms.</span>
<span class="s1">DEFAULT_DELAY </span><span class="s2">= </span><span class="s3">0.250</span>

<span class="s4"># How should we call getaddrinfo? In particular, should we use AI_ADDRCONFIG?</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># The idea of AI_ADDRCONFIG is that it only returns addresses that might</span>
<span class="s4"># work. E.g., if getaddrinfo knows that you don't have any IPv6 connectivity,</span>
<span class="s4"># then it doesn't return any IPv6 addresses. And this is kinda nice, because</span>
<span class="s4"># it means maybe you can skip sending AAAA requests entirely. But in practice,</span>
<span class="s4"># it doesn't really work right.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># - on Linux/glibc, empirically, the default is to return all addresses, and</span>
<span class="s4"># with AI_ADDRCONFIG then it only returns IPv6 addresses if there is at least</span>
<span class="s4"># one non-loopback IPv6 address configured... but this can be a link-local</span>
<span class="s4"># address, so in practice I guess this is basically always configured if IPv6</span>
<span class="s4"># is enabled at all. OTOH if you pass in &quot;::1&quot; as the target address with</span>
<span class="s4"># AI_ADDRCONFIG and there's no *external* IPv6 address configured, you get an</span>
<span class="s4"># error. So AI_ADDRCONFIG mostly doesn't do anything, even when you would want</span>
<span class="s4"># it to, and when it does do something it might break things that would have</span>
<span class="s4"># worked.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># - on Windows 10, empirically, if no IPv6 address is configured then by</span>
<span class="s4"># default they are also suppressed from getaddrinfo (flags=0 and</span>
<span class="s4"># flags=AI_ADDRCONFIG seem to do the same thing). If you pass AI_ALL, then you</span>
<span class="s4"># get the full list.</span>
<span class="s4"># ...except for localhost! getaddrinfo(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;80&quot;) gives me ::1, even</span>
<span class="s4"># though there's no ipv6 and other queries only return ipv4.</span>
<span class="s4"># If you pass in and IPv6 IP address as the target address, then that's always</span>
<span class="s4"># returned OK, even with AI_ADDRCONFIG set and no IPv6 configured.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># But I guess other versions of windows messed this up, judging from these bug</span>
<span class="s4"># reports:</span>
<span class="s4"># https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5234</span>
<span class="s4"># https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32522#c50</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># So basically the options are either to use AI_ADDRCONFIG and then add some</span>
<span class="s4"># complicated special cases to work around its brokenness, or else don't use</span>
<span class="s4"># AI_ADDRCONFIG and accept that sometimes on legacy/misconfigured networks</span>
<span class="s4"># we'll waste 300 ms trying to connect to a blackholed destination.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># Twisted and Tornado always uses default flags. I think we'll do the same.</span>

    <span class="s6">&quot;&quot;&quot;Connect to the given host and port over TCP. 
 
    If the given ``host`` has multiple IP addresses associated with it, then 
    we have a problem: which one do we use? 
 
    One approach would be to attempt to connect to the first one, and then if 
    that fails, attempt to connect to the second one ... until we've tried all 
    of them. But the problem with this is that if the first IP address is 
    unreachable (for example, because it's an IPv6 address and our network 
    discards IPv6 packets), then we might end up waiting tens of seconds for 
    the first connection attempt to timeout before we try the second address. 
 
    Another approach would be to attempt to connect to all of the addresses at 
    the same time, in parallel, and then use whichever connection succeeds 
    first, abandoning the others. This would be fast, but create a lot of 
    unnecessary load on the network and the remote server. 
 
    This function strikes a balance between these two extremes: it works its 
    way through the available addresses one at a time, like the first 
    approach; but, if ``happy_eyeballs_delay`` seconds have passed and it's 
    still waiting for an attempt to succeed or fail, then it gets impatient 
    and starts the next connection attempt in parallel. As soon as any one 
    connection attempt succeeds, all the other attempts are cancelled. This 
    avoids unnecessary load because most connections will succeed after just 
    one or two attempts, but if one of the addresses is unreachable then it 
    doesn't slow us down too much. 
 
    This is known as a &quot;happy eyeballs&quot; algorithm, and our particular variant 
    is modelled after how Chrome connects to webservers; see `RFC 6555 
    &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555&gt;`__ for more details. 
 
    Args: 
      host (str or bytes): The host to connect to. Can be an IPv4 address, 
          IPv6 address, or a hostname. 
 
      port (int): The port to connect to. 
 
      happy_eyeballs_delay (float): How many seconds to wait for each 
          connection attempt to succeed or fail before getting impatient and 
          starting another one in parallel. Set to `math.inf` if you want 
          to limit to only one connection attempt at a time (like 
          :func:`socket.create_connection`). Default: 0.25 (250 ms). 
 
      local_address (None or str): The local IP address or hostname to use as 
          the source for outgoing connections. If ``None``, we let the OS pick 
          the source IP. 
 
          This is useful in some exotic networking configurations where your 
          host has multiple IP addresses, and you want to force the use of a 
          specific one. 
 
          Note that if you pass an IPv4 ``local_address``, then you won't be 
          able to connect to IPv6 hosts, and vice-versa. If you want to take 
          advantage of this to force the use of IPv4 or IPv6 without 
          specifying an exact source address, you can use the IPv4 wildcard 
          address ``local_address=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;``, or the IPv6 wildcard address 
          ``local_address=&quot;::&quot;``. 
 
    Returns: 
      SocketStream: a :class:`~trio.abc.Stream` connected to the given server. 
 
    Raises: 
      OSError: if the connection fails.
