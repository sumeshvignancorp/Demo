<pre><span class="s0"># ParkingLot provides an abstraction for a fair waitqueue with cancellation</span>
<span class="s0"># and requeueing support. Inspiration:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#    https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/</span>
<span class="s0">#    https://amanieu.github.io/parking_lot/</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># which were in turn heavily influenced by</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#    http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/papers/aqs.pdf</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># Compared to these, our use of cooperative scheduling allows some</span>
<span class="s0"># simplifications (no need for internal locking). On the other hand, the need</span>
<span class="s0"># to support Trio's strong cancellation semantics adds some complications</span>
<span class="s0"># (tasks need to know where they're queued so they can cancel). Also, in the</span>
<span class="s0"># above work, the ParkingLot is a global structure that holds a collection of</span>
<span class="s0"># waitqueues keyed by lock address, and which are opportunistically allocated</span>
<span class="s0"># and destroyed as contention arises; this allows the worst-case memory usage</span>
<span class="s0"># for all waitqueues to be O(#tasks). Here we allocate a separate wait queue</span>
<span class="s0"># for each synchronization object, so we're O(#objects + #tasks). This isn't</span>
<span class="s0"># *so* bad since compared to our synchronization objects are heavier than</span>
<span class="s0"># theirs and our tasks are lighter, so for us #objects is smaller and #tasks</span>
<span class="s0"># is larger.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># This is in the core because for two reasons. First, it's used by</span>
<span class="s0"># UnboundedQueue, and UnboundedQueue is used for a number of things in the</span>
<span class="s0"># core. And second, it's responsible for providing fairness to all of our</span>
<span class="s0"># high-level synchronization primitives (locks, queues, etc.). For now with</span>
<span class="s0"># our FIFO scheduler this is relatively trivial (it's just a FIFO waitqueue),</span>
<span class="s0"># but in the future we ever start support task priorities or fair scheduling</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#    https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/32</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># then all we'll have to do is update this. (Well, full-fledged task</span>
<span class="s0"># priorities might also require priority inheritance, which would require more</span>
<span class="s0"># work.)</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># For discussion of data structures to use here, see:</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0">#     https://github.com/dabeaz/curio/issues/136</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># (and also the articles above). Currently we use a SortedDict ordered by a</span>
<span class="s0"># global monotonic counter that ensures FIFO ordering. The main advantage of</span>
<span class="s0"># this is that it's easy to implement :-). An intrusive doubly-linked list</span>
<span class="s0"># would also be a natural approach, so long as we only handle FIFO ordering.</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># XX: should we switch to the shared global ParkingLot approach?</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># XX: we should probably add support for &quot;parking tokens&quot; to allow for</span>
<span class="s0"># task-fair RWlock (basically: when parking a task needs to be able to mark</span>
<span class="s0"># itself as a reader or a writer, and then a task-fair wakeup policy is, wake</span>
<span class="s0"># the next task, and if it's a reader than keep waking tasks so long as they</span>
<span class="s0"># are readers). Without this I think you can implement write-biased or</span>
<span class="s0"># read-biased RWlocks (by using two parking lots and drawing from whichever is</span>
<span class="s0"># preferred), but not task-fair -- and task-fair plays much more nicely with</span>
<span class="s0"># WFQ. (Consider what happens in the two-lot implementation if you're</span>
<span class="s0"># write-biased but all the pending writers are blocked at the scheduler level</span>
<span class="s0"># by the WFQ logic...)</span>
<span class="s0"># ...alternatively, &quot;phase-fair&quot; RWlocks are pretty interesting:</span>
<span class="s0">#    http://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/papers/ecrts09b.pdf</span>
<span class="s0"># Useful summary:</span>
<span class="s0"># https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReadWriteLock.html</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># XX: if we do add WFQ, then we might have to drop the current feature where</span>
<span class="s0"># unpark returns the tasks that were unparked. Rationale: suppose that at the</span>
<span class="s0"># time we call unpark, the next task is deprioritized... and then, before it</span>
<span class="s0"># becomes runnable, a new task parks which *is* runnable. Ideally we should</span>
<span class="s0"># immediately wake the new task, and leave the old task on the queue for</span>
<span class="s0"># later. But this means we can't commit to which task we are unparking when</span>
<span class="s0"># unpark is called.</span>
