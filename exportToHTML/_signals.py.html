<span class="s3"># Discussion of signal handling strategies:</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># - On Windows signals barely exist. There are no options; signal handlers are</span>
<span class="s3">#   the only available API.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># - On Linux signalfd is arguably the natural way. Semantics: signalfd acts as</span>
<span class="s3">#   an *alternative* signal delivery mechanism. The way you use it is to mask</span>
<span class="s3">#   out the relevant signals process-wide (so that they don't get delivered</span>
<span class="s3">#   the normal way), and then when you read from signalfd that actually counts</span>
<span class="s3">#   as delivering it (despite the mask). The problem with this is that we</span>
<span class="s3">#   don't have any reliable way to mask out signals process-wide -- the only</span>
<span class="s3">#   way to do that in Python is to call pthread_sigmask from the main thread</span>
<span class="s3">#   *before starting any other threads*, and as a library we can't really</span>
<span class="s3">#   impose that, and the failure mode is annoying (signals get delivered via</span>
<span class="s3">#   signal handlers whether we want them to or not).</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># - on macOS/*BSD, kqueue is the natural way. Semantics: kqueue acts as an</span>
<span class="s3">#   *extra* signal delivery mechanism. Signals are delivered the normal</span>
<span class="s3">#   way, *and* are delivered to kqueue. So you want to set them to SIG_IGN so</span>
<span class="s3">#   that they don't end up pending forever (I guess?). I can't find any actual</span>
<span class="s3">#   docs on how masking and EVFILT_SIGNAL interact. I did see someone note</span>
<span class="s3">#   that if a signal is pending when the kqueue filter is added then you</span>
<span class="s3">#   *don't* get notified of that, which makes sense. But still, we have to</span>
<span class="s3">#   manipulate signal state (e.g. setting SIG_IGN) which as far as Python is</span>
<span class="s3">#   concerned means we have to do this from the main thread.</span>
<span class="s3">#</span>
<span class="s3"># So in summary, there don't seem to be any compelling advantages to using the</span>
<span class="s3"># platform-native signal notification systems; they're kinda nice, but it's</span>
<span class="s3"># simpler to implement the naive signal-handler-based system once and be</span>
<span class="s3"># done. (The big advantage would be if there were a reliable way to monitor</span>
<span class="s3"># for SIGCHLD from outside the main thread and without interfering with other</span>
<span class="s3"># libraries that also want to monitor for SIGCHLD. But there isn't. I guess</span>
<span class="s3"># kqueue might give us that, but in kqueue we don't need it, because kqueue</span>
<span class="s3"># can directly monitor for child process state changes.)</span>

    <span class="s5">&quot;&quot;&quot;A context manager for catching signals. 
 
    Entering this context manager starts listening for the given signals and 
    returns an async iterator; exiting the context manager stops listening. 
 
    The async iterator blocks until a signal arrives, and then yields it. 
 
    Note that if you leave the ``with`` block while the iterator has 
    unextracted signals still pending inside it, then they will be 
    re-delivered using Python's regular signal handling logic. This avoids a 
    race condition when signals arrives just before we exit the ``with`` 
    block. 
 
    Args: 
      signals: the signals to listen for. 
 
    Raises: 
      TypeError: if no signals were provided. 
 
      RuntimeError: if you try to use this anywhere except Python's main 
          thread. (This is a Python limitation.) 
 
    Example: 
 
      A common convention for Unix daemons is that they should reload their 
      configuration when they receive a ``SIGHUP``. Here's a sketch of what 
      that might look like using :func:`open_signal_receiver`:: 
 
         with trio.open_signal_receiver(signal.SIGHUP) as signal_aiter: 
             async for signum in signal_aiter: 
                 assert signum == signal.SIGHUP
