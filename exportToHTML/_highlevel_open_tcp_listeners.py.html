<span class="s4"># Default backlog size:</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># Having the backlog too low can cause practical problems (a perfectly healthy</span>
<span class="s4"># service that starts failing to accept connections if they arrive in a</span>
<span class="s4"># burst).</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># Having it too high doesn't really cause any problems. Like any buffer, you</span>
<span class="s4"># want backlog queue to be zero usually, and it won't save you if you're</span>
<span class="s4"># getting connection attempts faster than you can call accept() on an ongoing</span>
<span class="s4"># basis. But unlike other buffers, this one doesn't really provide any</span>
<span class="s4"># backpressure. If a connection gets stuck waiting in the backlog queue, then</span>
<span class="s4"># from the peer's point of view the connection succeeded but then their</span>
<span class="s4"># send/recv will stall until we get to it, possibly for a long time. OTOH if</span>
<span class="s4"># there isn't room in the backlog queue... then their connect stalls, possibly</span>
<span class="s4"># for a long time, which is pretty much the same thing.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># A large backlog can also use a bit more kernel memory, but this seems fairly</span>
<span class="s4"># negligible these days.</span>
<span class="s4">#</span>
<span class="s4"># So this suggests we should make the backlog as large as possible. This also</span>
<span class="s4"># matches what Golang does. However, they do it in a weird way, where they</span>
<span class="s4"># have a bunch of code to sniff out the configured upper limit for backlog on</span>
<span class="s4"># different operating systems. But on every system, passing in a too-large</span>
<span class="s4"># backlog just causes it to be silently truncated to the configured maximum,</span>
<span class="s4"># so this is unnecessary -- we can just pass in &quot;infinity&quot; and get the maximum</span>
<span class="s4"># that way. (Verified on Windows, Linux, macOS using</span>

    Args: 
 
      port (int): The port to listen on. 
 
          If you use 0 as your port, then the kernel will automatically pick 
          an arbitrary open port. But be careful: if you use this feature when 
          binding to multiple IP addresses, then each IP address will get its 
          own random port, and the returned listeners will probably be 
          listening on different ports. In particular, this will happen if you 
          use ``host=None`` – which is the default – because in this case 
          :func:`open_tcp_listeners` will bind to both the IPv4 wildcard 
          address (``0.0.0.0``) and also the IPv6 wildcard address (``::``). 
 
      host (str, bytes-like, or None): The local interface to bind to. This is 
          passed to :func:`~socket.getaddrinfo` with the ``AI_PASSIVE`` flag 
          set. 
 
          If you want to bind to the wildcard address on both IPv4 and IPv6, 
          in order to accept connections on all available interfaces, then 
          pass ``None``. This is the default. 
 
          If you have a specific interface you want to bind to, pass its IP 
          address or hostname here. If a hostname resolves to multiple IP 
          addresses, this function will open one listener on each of them. 
 
          If you want to use only IPv4, or only IPv6, but want to accept on 
          all interfaces, pass the family-specific wildcard address: 
          ``&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;`` for IPv4-only and ``&quot;::&quot;`` for IPv6-only. 
 
      backlog (int or None): The listen backlog to use. If you leave this as 
          ``None`` then Trio will pick a good default. (Currently: whatever 
          your system has configured as the maximum backlog.)

<span class="s2">):</span>
    <span class="s5">&quot;&quot;&quot;Listen for incoming TCP connections, and for each one start a task 
    running ``handler(stream)``. 
 
    This is a thin convenience wrapper around :func:`open_tcp_listeners` and 
    :func:`serve_listeners` – see them for full details. 
 
    .. warning:: 
 
       If ``handler`` raises an exception, then this function doesn't do 
       anything special to catch it – so by default the exception will 
       propagate out and crash your server. If you don't want this, then catch 
       exceptions inside your ``handler``, or use a ``handler_nursery`` object 
       that responds to exceptions in some other way. 
 
    When used with ``nursery.start`` you get back the newly opened listeners. 
    So, for example, if you want to start a server in your test suite and then 
    connect to it to check that it's working properly, you can use something 
    like:: 
 
        from trio.testing import open_stream_to_socket_listener 
 
        async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery: 
            listeners = await nursery.start(serve_tcp, handler, 0) 
            client_stream = await open_stream_to_socket_listener(listeners[0]) 
 
            # Then send and receive data on 'client_stream', for example: 
            await client_stream.send_all(b&quot;GET / HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\r\\n&quot;) 
 
    This avoids several common pitfalls: 
 
    1. It lets the kernel pick a random open port, so your test suite doesn't 
       depend on any particular port being open. 
 
    2. It waits for the server to be accepting connections on that port before 
       ``start`` returns, so there's no race condition where the incoming 
       connection arrives before the server is ready. 
 
    3. It uses the Listener object to find out which port was picked, so it 
       can connect to the right place. 
 
    Args: 
      handler: The handler to start for each incoming connection. Passed to 
          :func:`serve_listeners`. 
 
      port: The port to listen on. Use 0 to let the kernel pick an open port. 
          Passed to :func:`open_tcp_listeners`. 
 
      host (str, bytes, or None): The host interface to listen on; use 
          ``None`` to bind to the wildcard address. Passed to 
          :func:`open_tcp_listeners`. 
 
      backlog: The listen backlog, or None to have a good default picked. 
          Passed to :func:`open_tcp_listeners`. 
 
      handler_nursery: The nursery to start handlers in, or None to use an 
          internal nursery. Passed to :func:`serve_listeners`. 
 
      task_status: This function can be used with ``nursery.start``. 
 
    Returns: 
      This function only returns when cancelled.
