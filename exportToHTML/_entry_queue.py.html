    <span class="s5">&quot;&quot;&quot;An opaque object representing a single call to :func:`trio.run`. 
 
    It has no public constructor; instead, see :func:`current_trio_token`. 
 
    This object has two uses: 
 
    1. It lets you re-enter the Trio run loop from external threads or signal 
       handlers. This is the low-level primitive that :func:`trio.to_thread` 
       and `trio.from_thread` use to communicate with worker threads, that 
       `trio.open_signal_receiver` uses to receive notifications about 
       signals, and so forth. 
 
    2. Each call to :func:`trio.run` has exactly one associated 
       :class:`TrioToken` object, so you can use it to identify a particular 
       call. 
 
    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="s1">_reentry_queue </span><span class="s2">= </span><span class="s1">attr</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1">ib</span><span class="s2">()</span>

        <span class="s5">&quot;&quot;&quot;Schedule a call to ``sync_fn(*args)`` to occur in the context of a 
        Trio task. 
 
        This is safe to call from the main thread, from other threads, and 
        from signal handlers. This is the fundamental primitive used to 
        re-enter the Trio run loop from outside of it. 
 
        The call will happen &quot;soon&quot;, but there's no guarantee about exactly 
        when, and no mechanism provided for finding out when it's happened. 
        If you need this, you'll have to build your own. 
 
        The call is effectively run as part of a system task (see 
        :func:`~trio.lowlevel.spawn_system_task`). In particular this means 
        that: 
 
        * :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` protection is *enabled* by default; if 
          you want ``sync_fn`` to be interruptible by control-C, then you 
          need to use :func:`~trio.lowlevel.disable_ki_protection` 
          explicitly. 
 
        * If ``sync_fn`` raises an exception, then it's converted into a 
          :exc:`~trio.TrioInternalError` and *all* tasks are cancelled. You 
          should be careful that ``sync_fn`` doesn't crash. 
 
        All calls with ``idempotent=False`` are processed in strict 
        first-in first-out order. 
 
        If ``idempotent=True``, then ``sync_fn`` and ``args`` must be 
        hashable, and Trio will make a best-effort attempt to discard any 
        call submission which is equal to an already-pending call. Trio 
        will process these in first-in first-out order. 
 
        Any ordering guarantees apply separately to ``idempotent=False`` 
        and ``idempotent=True`` calls; there's no rule for how calls in the 
        different categories are ordered with respect to each other. 
 
        :raises trio.RunFinishedError: 
              if the associated call to :func:`trio.run` 
              has already exited. (Any call that *doesn't* raise this error 
              is guaranteed to be fully processed before :func:`trio.run` 
              exits.)
